CAFFE
=====

Computational Algorithm Framework for Fluid Equations (CAFFE) is a collection of algorithms for solving various physics problems using any number of different domains, solvers and spatial discretization schemes. Available solvers include both explicit and implicit time marching schemes, and domains include finite-volume meshes, finite-difference meses, finite-element meshes and particle domains.
