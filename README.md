CAFFE
=====

Computational Algorithm Framework for Fluid Equations (CAFFE) is a collection of finite volume algorithms for solving incompressible fluid equations, with more functionality to be released later. The primary focus of this code is to solve multiphase problems with complex geometry utilizing the immersed boundary method. Both explicit and implicit solvers are available. The code is organized to be as simple and modular, to make development and maintenance as intuitive as possible.
